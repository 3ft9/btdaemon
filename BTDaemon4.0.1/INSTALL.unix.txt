Before installing BitTorrent 4.0.1, remove any older versions of the
BitTorrent client that may be installed.

Most of the following instructions require root privileges.

How to install BitTorrent on a generic UNIX system:
----------------------------------------
Install Python, version 2.2.1 or later
http://python.org/

Install GTK, version 2.2 or later
http://gtk.org/

Install pygtk, version 2.4 or later
http://pygtk.org/

Optionally install dnspython, version 1.3.2 or later, if you want to
be notified when there is a newer version of BitTorrent available
http://www.dnspython.org/

Optionally, apply dnspython_patch.diff to dns/resolver.py, found in
$PYTHONPATH or python's sys.path. (This patch prevents dnspython from
using a lot of CPU when you have no network connection and is mainly
only important under Windows.)

Install BitTorrent by running 
python setup.py install

Optionally, untar and put a line in /etc/mailcap which is similar to
the following, only replace the path to /usr/bin/btdownloadgui.py with
the one it's actually in.

application/x-bittorrent; /usr/bin/btdownloadgui.py %s; test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

You may have to restart your web browser for it to start using
BitTorrent.

If you're using a web browser which doesn't respect /etc/mailcap you
can go into the mime-type configuration for your web browser and
manually associate application/x-bittorrent with btdownloadgui.py
(with the appropriate path, of course.)


How to build a .deb format Debian package and install it:
----------------------------------------
First, remove any older versions of BitTorrent that may be installed:
(this command will also remove BitTornado)
apt-get remove bittorrent bittorrent-gui

python setup.py bdist_dumb
cd dist/
alien BitTorrent-4.0.1.linux-i686.tar.gz

you should now have a .deb package in: bittorrent-4.0.1.linux_i686-2_all.deb

then install the .deb
dpkg -i bittorrent-4.0.1.linux_i686-2_all.deb


How to build an .rpm format package and install it:
----------------------------------------
python setup.py bdist_rpm
rpm -i dist/BitTorrent-4.0.1-1.noarch.rpm
